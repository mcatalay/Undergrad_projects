# Undergrad_projects
These are some homework and coding projects from Undergrad

Stat 224: Applied Regression Analysis was the first applied statistics class I took. Uploaded are the 2 reports from that class that made up the bulk of the grade. Mostly linear regression analysis in R with visualizations in `ggplot2`. 

I took Big Data and Machine Learning at the end of my 3rd year. I uploaded the take-home midterm that features applications of LASSO and clustering and an application of Randomforest in R for my final group project.

I took Stat 245 which is the second quarter of statistical methods and theory class at UChicago. These were 2 psets that featured some applied work in R, mostly data simulation and generation. 

I also took Applied Econometrics and Data Science methods my 4th year. The final project of that class eventually became my thesis, but simulation-3.Rmd is a excerpt from a pset. Application of `dplyr` for some data wrangling and optimization for MLE estimation in R.
